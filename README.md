## Purpose:
-  which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office"
## Requirements:
- Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:
       - Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
       - Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
       - A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
           - Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
           - Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
           - Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
           - Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
     - A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
        - A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
        - An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
        - A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"
